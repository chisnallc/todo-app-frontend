   Shopping List For Dinner to-do App

This App was created to enable the user to add a list of potential igredients to create a meal.

In order to use the todo list, the ingredient must be typed into the task box. The add button is pressed and the ingredient is added to the list.
Once added a delete button and a done button will appear.

When the ingredient has been shopped the done button should be clicked. This will represent the task as completed. If the shopping list has an ingredient added in error, the delete button will remove it from the list.

There is also a counter function which has been incorperated onto the sites page. As the task is added, the counter will increment. The counter will decrement when the ingredient is deleted or completed.
This has been linked to a backend system with AWS/MySQL the file is called backend todo.

Instructions to load the website are below.
